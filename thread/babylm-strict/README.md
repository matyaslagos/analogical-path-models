## Data Decontamination

All training data was subjected to precorpus debiasing using pipeline for detecting and removing toxic content from naturalistic language corpora. The pipeline applies hate speech detection, sentiment scoring, and emotion analysis to flag problematic sentences, which are then filtered using gender and race word lists alongside an explicit slur lexicon. This ensures that demographic mentions and identity-related language in the corpus do not carry harmful associations that could be learned by models trained on this data. Training Data Decontamination was motivated by efforts on the Interaction Track (e.g., Salhan et al 2025; Trhlik, Caines & Buttery 2026).
